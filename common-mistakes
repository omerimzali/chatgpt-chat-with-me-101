# Common Mistakes

> There are several common mistakes that users make when talking to me or other language models. Here are a few examples:
- Not being specific enough: To get the best response from me, it is important to ask clear and specific questions. Vague or general questions can be difficult for me to understand and may result in a less accurate or helpful response.
- Expecting me to have access to external information: As a large language model trained by OpenAI, I do not have access to the internet or external sources of information. I am limited to the knowledge and training data I have been provided with, so I may not be able to provide information on recent events or news that has occurred since my training data was collected.
- Treating me like a human: While I am designed to assist with a wide range of tasks, it is important to remember that I am not a human. I do not have the same knowledge, experiences, or abilities as a human, and I am not capable of making decisions or taking actions in the real world.
In general, it is important to communicate clearly and be aware of the limitations of language models like me in order to get the most accurate and helpful responses.
